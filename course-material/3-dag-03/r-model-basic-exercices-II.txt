### Exercises

```
1.Instead of using lm() to fit a straight line, you can use loess() to fit a smooth curve. 
  Repeat the process of model fitting, grid generation, predictions, and visualisation on sim1 using loess() instead of lm(). 
  How does the result compare to geom_smooth()?
  
2. add_predictions() is paired with gather_predictions() and spread_predictions(). How do these three functions differ?

3. What does geom_ref_line() do? What package does it come from? Why is displaying a reference line in plots showing residuals useful and important?

4.Why might you want to look at a frequency polygon of absolute residuals? What are the pros and cons compared to looking at the raw residuals?
