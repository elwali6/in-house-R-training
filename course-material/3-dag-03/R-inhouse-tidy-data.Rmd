# Data Management II

## Tidy data
You can represent the same underlying data in multiple ways. 

The example below shows the same data organised in four different ways. Each dataset shows the same values of four variables country, year, population, and cases, but each dataset organises the values in a different way.

## 
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
table1
```

##

```{r}
table2
```
##

```{r}
table3
```

##

```{r}
table4a
```
##

```{r}
table4b
```

## 
These are all representations of the same underlying data, but they are not equally easy to use. One dataset, the tidy dataset, will be much easier to work with inside the tidyverse.

There are three interrelated rules which make a dataset tidy:

* Each variable must have its own column.

* Each observation must have its own row.

* Each value must have its own cell.

## 

```{r tidy-structure, echo = FALSE, out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "Following three rules makes a dataset tidy: variables are in columns, observations are in rows, and values are in cells."}
knitr::include_graphics("img/tidy-1.png")
```


##
These three rules are interrelated because it's impossible to only satisfy two of the three. That interrelationship leads to an even simpler set of practical instructions:

Put each dataset in a tibble.
Put each variable in a column.
In this example, only table1 is tidy. It's the only representation where each column is a variable.

## Why ensure that your data is `tidy`? 

There are two main advantages:

There's a general advantage to picking one consistent way of storing data. If you have a consistent data structure, it's easier to learn the tools that work with it because they have an underlying uniformity.

There's a specific advantage to placing variables in columns because it allows `R`'s vectorised nature to shine. As you learned in `mutate` and `summary` functions, most built-in R functions work with vectors of values. That makes transforming tidy data feel particularly natural.

`dplyr`, `ggplot2`, and all the other packages in the `tidyverse` are designed to work with tidy data. Here are a couple of small examples showing how you might work with table1.

##
```{r}
# Compute rate per 10,000
table1 %>% 
  mutate(rate = cases / population * 10000)
```

##

```{r}

# Compute cases per year
table1 %>% 
  count(year, wt = cases)
```

##
```{r}
# Visualise changes over time
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(table1, aes(year, cases)) + 
  geom_line(aes(group = country), colour = "grey50") + 
  geom_point(aes(colour = country))
```


## Spreading and gathering

The first step in a data analyse proeject is always to figure out what the variables and observations are. Sometimes this is easy; other times you'll need to consult with the people who originally generated the data. The second step is to resolve one of two common problems:

* One variable might be spread across multiple columns.

* One observation might be scattered across multiple rows.

Typically a dataset will only suffer from one of these problems; it'll only suffer from both if you're really unlucky! To fix these problems, you'll need the two most important functions in tidyr: `gather()` and `spread()`.

## `gather()`
A common problem is a dataset where some of the column names are not names of variables, but values of a variable. Take table4a: the column names 1999 and 2000 represent values of the year variable, and each row represents two observations, not one.

```{r}
table4a
```

##
To tidy a dataset like this, we need to gather those columns into a new pair of variables. To describe that operation we need three parameters:

The set of columns that represent values, not variables. In this example, those are the columns 1999 and 2000.

The name of the variable whose values form the column names. This is called  the `key`, and here it is year.

The name of the variable whose values are spread over the cells. This is called `value`, and here it's the number of cases.

Together those parameters generate the call to `gather()`:

##
```{r}
table4a %>% 
  gather(`1999`, `2000`, key = "year", value = "cases")
```
##
The columns to gather are specified with `dplyr::select()` style notation. Here there are only two columns, so we list them individually. Note that "1999" and "2000" are non-syntactic names so we have to surround them in backticks. To refresh your memory of the other ways to select columns, see select.


```{r tidy-gather, echo = FALSE, out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "Gathering `table4a` into a tidy form."}
knitr::include_graphics("img/tidy-9.png")
```

##
In the final result, the gathered columns are dropped, and we get new `key` and `value` columns. Otherwise, the relationships between the original variables are preserved. Visually, this is shown in Figure \@ref(fig:tidy-gather). We can use `gather()` to tidy `table4b` in a similar fashion. The only difference is the variable stored in the cell values:

##
```{r}
table4b %>% 
  gather(`1999`, `2000`, key = "year", value = "population")
```
##
To combine the tidied versions of table4a and table4b into a single tibble, we need to use `dplyr::left_join()`, which you'll learn about in [relational data].

```{r}
tidy4a <- table4a %>% 
  gather(`1999`, `2000`, key = "year", value = "cases")
tidy4b <- table4b %>% 
  gather(`1999`, `2000`, key = "year", value = "population")
left_join(tidy4a, tidy4b)
```

## `spread()`
Spreading is the opposite of gathering. You use it when an observation is scattered across multiple rows. For example, take table2: an observation is a country in a year, but each observation is spread across two rows.
```{r}
table2
```

## 
To tidy this up, we first analyse the representation in similar way to `gather()`. This time, however, we only need two parameters:

The column that contains variable names, the `key` column. Here, it's type.

The column that contains values forms multiple variables, the `value` column. Here it's count.

Once we've figured that out, we can use spread(), as shown programmatically below, and visually in Figure @ref(fig:tidy-spread).

## 
```{r}
spread(table2, key = type, value = count)
```

##

```{r tidy-spread, echo = FALSE, out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "Spreading `table2` makes it tidy"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/tidy-8.png")
```

## Separating and uniting
So far you've learned how to tidy `table2` and `table4`, but not `table3`. 

`table3` has a different problem: we have one column (rate) that contains two variables (cases and population). To fix this problem, we'll need the `separate()` function. You'll also learn about the complement of `separate()`: `unite()`, which you use if a single variable is spread across multiple columns.

## `separate()`
`separate()` pulls apart one column into multiple columns, by splitting wherever a separator character appears. Take table3:

```{r}
table3
```

## 
The `rate` column contains both `cases` and `population` variables, and we need to split it into two variables. `separate()` takes the name of the column to separate, and the names of the columns to separate into, as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:tidy-separate) and the code below.

```{r}
table3 %>% 
  separate(rate, into = c("cases", "population"))
```

## 

```{r tidy-separate, echo = FALSE, out.width = "75%", fig.cap = "Separating `table3` makes it tidy"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/tidy-17.png")
```

## 
Separating table3 makes it tidy

By default, `separate()` will split values wherever it sees a non-alphanumeric character (i.e. a character that isn't a number or letter). For example, in the code above, `separate()` split the values of rate at the forward slash characters. If you wish to use a specific character to separate a column, you can pass the character to the sep argument of `separate()`. For example, we could rewrite the code above as:

##
```{r }
table3 %>% 
  separate(rate, into = c("cases", "population"), sep = "")
```

## 
Look carefully at the column types: you'll notice that `case` and `population` are character columns. This is the default behaviour in `separate()`: it leaves the type of the column as is. Here, however, it's not very useful as those really are numbers. We can ask `separate()` to try and convert to better types using `convert = TRUE`:

##

```{r}
table3 %>% separate(rate, into = c("cases", "population"), convert = TRUE)
```
##
You can also pass a vector of integers to `sep`. `separate()` will interpret the integers as positions to split at. Positive values start at 1 on the far-left of the strings; negative value start at -1 on the far-right of the strings. When using integers to separate strings, the length of `sep` should be one less than the number of names in `into`. 

You can use this arrangement to separate the last two digits of each year. This make this data less tidy, but is useful in other cases, as you'll see in a little bit.
##
```{r}
table3 %>% separate(year, into = c("century", "year"), sep = 2)
```


## `unite()`

`unite()` is the inverse of `separate()`: it combines multiple columns into a single column. You'll need it much less frequently than `separate()`, but it's still a useful tool to have in your back pocket.


```{r tidy-unite, echo = FALSE, out.width = "75%", fig.cap = "Uniting `table5` makes it tidy"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/tidy-18.png")
```

## 

We can use `unite()` to rejoin the *century* and *year* columns that we created in the last example. That data is saved as `tidyr::table5`. `unite()` takes a data frame, the name of the new variable to create, and a set of columns to combine, again specified in `dplyr::select()` style:

```{r}
table5 %>% 
  unite(new, century, year)
```

In this case we also need to use the `sep` argument. The default will place an underscore (`_`) between the values from different columns. Here we don't want any separator so we use `""`:

```{r}
table5 %>% 
  unite(new, century, year, sep = "")
```
