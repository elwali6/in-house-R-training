### Exercises 



### Exercises

1.  What happens if you repeat the analysis of `sim2` using a model without
    an intercept. What happens to the model equation? What happens to the
    predictions?
    
2.  Use `model_matrix()` to explore the equations generated for the models
    I fit to `sim3` and `sim4`. Why is `*` a good shorthand for interaction?

3.  Using the basic principles, convert the formulas in the following two
    models into functions. (Hint: start by converting the categorical variable
    into 0-1 variables.)
    
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    mod1 <- lm(y ~ x1 + x2, data = sim3)
    mod2 <- lm(y ~ x1 * x2, data = sim3)
    ```

4.   For `sim4`,  which of `mod1` and `mod2` is better? I think `mod2` does a 
     slightly better job at removing patterns, but it's pretty subtle. Can you 
     come up with a plot to support my claim?
